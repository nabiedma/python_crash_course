get# We can also use the range() function to tell Python to skip numbers in a
# given range. If you pass a third argument to range() , Python uses that value
# as a step size when generating numbers.
# For example, hereâ€™s how to list the even numbers between 1 and 10:

even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))
print(even_numbers)

# In this example, the range() function starts with the value 2 and then
# adds 2 to that value. It adds 2 repeatedly until it reaches or passes the end
# value, 11.
